2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CeldaGHOST/Cont100ms/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CeldaGHOST/Cont100ms/FSM_sequential_e_act[1]_i_2/O, cell CeldaGHOST/Cont100ms/FSM_sequential_e_act[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PINTAc/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PINTAc/sbtns_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell PINTAc/sbtns_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PINTAc/PSJ_reg[2]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PINTAc/drres_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell PINTAc/drres_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net RTCPSJ/pixel2_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin RTCPSJ/pixel_reg_i_2/O, cell RTCPSJ/pixel_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net SYNCVGA/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[9]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin SYNCVGA/Contfils/PSJ_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell SYNCVGA/Contfils/PSJ_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT CeldaGHOST/Cont100ms/FSM_sequential_e_act[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
CeldaGHOST/ContCols/counter_reg_reg[0],
CeldaGHOST/ContCols/counter_reg_reg[1],
CeldaGHOST/ContCols/counter_reg_reg[2],
CeldaGHOST/ContCols/counter_reg_reg[3],
CeldaGHOST/ContCols/counter_reg_reg[4],
CeldaGHOST/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[0],
CeldaGHOST/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[1],
CeldaGHOST/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[2],
CeldaGHOST/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[3],
CeldaGHOST/Contfils/counter_reg_reg[4],
CeldaGHOST/FSM_sequential_e_act_reg[0]
CeldaGHOST/FSM_sequential_e_act_reg[1]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
